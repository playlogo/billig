## Filament holder

I'll reuse the original "Filament clip-on holder". I've added a PTFE tube mount to the top of the printer to guide the filament over the top edge and into the printing area:

*I'll add a PTFE tube to the purple section*

## Bed mount

The two heatbeds will be mounted to the vertical aluminum extrusions using the silicon bed spacers, and the vertical extrusions will be mounted to the frame using these 90deg brackets (inspired by the voron 2.4 bed mount, since it can hold the sold aluminum bed, it should be strong enough to hold the cheap pcb heatbed)

## Z-Lead screw bottom Assembly

Stackup of the bottom assembly:

- Printed top-cover part
- 608 barring
- Printed Spacer
- GT 40T pulley
- 608 barring
- Printed bottom part

## BOM: Screws, etc

I have various screws and other stuff left from the two Kobra printers and the Ender3NG I just build. The BOM only contains the fasteners I'm personally missing to build the printer, not all the required ones!
